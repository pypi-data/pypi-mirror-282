# ESP Helper
## Description
ESP Helper is designed to streamline the development process with ESP32 and ESP8266 boards by simplifying common tasks.
In its default run mode, ESP Helper takes a serial port as an argument as well as the chip type, and attempts to flash 
all files from `./scripts` to the device.  Enhancing this feature is the ability to swap environment variables in the 
script prior to flashing, enabling the use of different variable sets for staged deployments.  Additionally, ESP Helper
can erase and flash the firmware of the device, with the default behavior being to automatically attempt to download the
latest firmware from micropython.org.

## Usage
```
Usage: main.py [OPTIONS] SERIAL_PORT

Options:
  --baud-rate INTEGER     Baud rate for the serial communication (default:
                          115200)
  --scripts-path TEXT     Absolute path to the directory that holds the
                          scripts to flash.
  --chip [ESP32|ESP8266]  Specify the chip type (ESP32 or ESP8266)  [required]
  --new-firmware          Erase and flash firmware. If --firmware-file is not
                          specified, this script will attempt to download the
                          latest firmware from micropython.org
  --firmware-file TEXT    Path to Micropython firmware bin to flash
  --write-env-vars        Overwrite environment variables in the script
                          (os.environ['ENV_VAR']) with local environment
                          variables
  --help                  Show this message and exit.

```

### Default Operation
The default operation of the script is to attempt to flash all files from the `./scripts` directory to the specified chip on the specified port.

### Environment Variable Substitution
When the `--write-env-vars` flag is used, ESP Helper will replace instances of `os.environ['VARIABLE']` with the environment variable of the same name.
The modified script is written to a temp file before being flashed and cleaned up.

This feature can be leveraged to apply different variable sets for different environments, allowing for staged deployments.

### Erase and Flash Firmware
The `--new-firmware` flag causes the script to erase the current firmware and flash new firmware.  If `--firmware-file` 
is not specified, the script will attempt to download the latest .bin firmware from micropython.org.
