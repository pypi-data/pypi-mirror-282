            ### Instruction:
            Given the following query, write a double newline separated list of up to {num_outputs} advanced queries meant to help answer the original query.
            DO NOT generate any single query which is likely to require information from multiple distinct documents.
            EACH single query will be used to carry out a cosine similarity semantic search over distinct indexed documents.
            FOR EXAMPLE, if asked `how do the key themes of Great Gatsby compare with 1984`, the two queries would be
            `What are the key themes of Great Gatsby?` and `What are the key themes of 1984?`.
            Here is the original user query to be transformed into answers:

            ### Query:
