``simframe`` Documentation
=========================================

| ``simframe`` is a Python framework to facilitate scientific simulations. The scope of the software is to provide a framework which can hold data fields, which can be used to integrate differential equations, and which can read and write data files.

| Data fields are stored in modified ``numpy.ndarrays``. Therefore, ``simframe`` can only work with data, that can be stored in ``NumPy`` arrays.

| To install ``simframe`` simply type
| ``pip install simframe``

| Please have a look at the following examples to learn how to use ``simframe``.
