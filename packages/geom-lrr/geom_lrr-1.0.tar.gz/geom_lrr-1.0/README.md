# LRR-Annotation

Tools for automatic annotation of leucine-rich repeat domains in protein structures. 

To use, make a new virtual / Conda environment and call:
```
pip install -e .
```

The Jupyter notebook `demo.ipynb` shows the basic operation of the pipeline, and writes
a number of `pdf` plots into the `plots` directory. The figures of the paper will be generated
by Jupyter notebooks in the `figures` directory.
