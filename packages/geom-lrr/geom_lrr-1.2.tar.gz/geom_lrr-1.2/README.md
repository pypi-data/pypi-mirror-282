# LRR-Annotation

Tools for automatic annotation of leucine-rich repeat domains in protein structures. 

Our code is available as a `pip` package on PyPI: you can either install it
with
```
pip install geom-lrr
```
or clone the repository and install in-place with
```
pip install -e .
```

The Jupyter notebook `demo.ipynb` shows the basic operation of the pipeline, and writes
a number of `pdf` plots into the `plots` directory. The figures of the paper will be generated
by Jupyter notebooks in the `figures` directory.
