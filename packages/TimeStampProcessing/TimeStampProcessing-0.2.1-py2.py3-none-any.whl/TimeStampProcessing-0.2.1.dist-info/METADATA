- **merge_threshold (timedelta)**: A `timedelta` object that specifies the maximum gap between ranges that should be considered for merging. Ranges closer than this threshold will be merged together.

**Returns**

- **list of tuples**: Returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a merged time range.

**Example Usage**

Here's how you can use the `merge_close_ranges` function to merge time ranges that are within two seconds of each other:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import timestampprocessing as tsp

# Example list of time ranges
time_ranges = [
    (datetime(2021, 7, 15, 12, 0, 0), datetime(2021, 7, 15, 12, 30, 0)),
    (datetime(2021, 7, 15, 12, 30, 1), datetime(2021, 7, 15, 13, 0, 0)),
    (datetime(2021, 7, 15, 14, 0, 0), datetime(2021, 7, 15, 14, 30, 0))
]

# Setting the merge threshold to 2 seconds
merge_threshold = timedelta(seconds=2)

# Merging close or overlapping ranges
merged_ranges = tsp.merge_close_ranges(time_ranges, merge_threshold)

for start, end in merged_ranges:
    print(f"Range from {start} to {end}")
```

### Interpolating Timestamp Values

The `interp_ts_vals` function calculates interpolated values at specific times based on linear interpolation between two known data points. This function is ideal for applications such as data imputation, sensor data analysis, and financial forecasting where precise intermediate values are needed between two known data points.

**Functionality**

This function employs linear interpolation to estimate values at a given timestamp, based on the values at two bounding timestamps. It is particularly useful for filling gaps in datasets, enhancing the granularity of sparse data, or any situation where data points are missing or expected at times between recorded values.

**Parameters**

- **start_time (str)**: The start time as a string in any recognizable datetime format, representing the first data point.
- **end_time (str)**: The end time as a string in any recognizable datetime format, representing the second data point.
- **start_value (float)**: The data value at the start time.
- **end_value (float)**: The data value at the end time.
- **current_time (str)**: The time at which the value needs to be interpolated, formatted as a string in the same format as the start and end times.

**Example Usage**

Suppose you have sensor data measuring temperature every hour, but you need to estimate the temperature at a half-hour mark:

```python
import timestampprocessing as tsp

# Known temperature readings at 1:00 PM and 2:00 PM
start_time = '2023-07-01 13:00:00'
end_time = '2023-07-01 14:00:00'
start_value = 22.0  # Temperature in degrees Celsius
end_value = 24.0    # Temperature in degrees Celsius

# Time for which you need an estimated temperature
current_time = '2023-07-01 13:30:00'

# Interpolate the temperature at 1:30 PM
interpolated_value = tsp.interp_ts_vals(start_time, end_time, start_value, end_value, current_time)
print(f"Interpolated Temperature at {current_time}: {interpolated_value:.2f}Â°C")
```

### Resampling a DataFrame with Linear Interpolation

The `resample_datetime_df` function resamples a pandas DataFrame that has a timestamp index to a specified interval in seconds, and fills any resulting gaps using linear interpolation. This function is highly valuable for processing time series data where uniform sampling intervals are required for analysis or visualization.

**Functionality**

This function adjusts the frequency of time series data by resampling the data to a new, specified frequency. It calculates the mean of the data within each new interval and applies linear interpolation to fill in any missing data points, ensuring a continuous set of data without gaps.

**Parameters**

- **df (pandas.DataFrame)**: The input DataFrame which must have a datetime index.
- **interval_seconds (int)**: The interval, in seconds, to which the DataFrame's data should be resampled.

**Example Usage**

Suppose you have environmental sensor data recorded at irregular intervals and you need to analyze it at regular 10-minute intervals:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import timestampprocessing as tsp
# Creating a sample DataFrame with irregular time intervals
times = pd.to_datetime(['2023-01-01 12:00', '2023-01-01 12:05', '2023-01-01 12:19', '2023-01-01 12:33', '2023-01-01 12:47', '2023-01-01 12:58'])
data = np.random.rand(6, 1)  # Random data
df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=times, columns=['Sensor_Reading'])

# Resample the DataFrame to every 10 minutes
resampled_df = tsp.resample_datetime_df(df, 600)  # 600 seconds = 10 minutes
print(resampled_df)
```

### Retrieving Statistical Values from Time Series Data

The `get_ts_statistic_value` function calculates and retrieves specific statistical measures from a pandas DataFrame that has a datetime index and one numerical column. This function is ideal for data analysis applications where insights into data distributions, such as maximum, minimum, mean, and various percentiles, are required.

**Functionality**

This function provides a flexible way to compute various statistical measures from a single-column DataFrame indexed by datetime. It supports a range of statistical calculations including max, min, mean, median (middle), various percentiles, and mode (most), facilitating detailed and specific data analysis tasks.

**Parameters**

- **df (pandas.DataFrame)**: The input DataFrame, which must have a datetime index and exactly one numerical column.
- **statistic (str)**: The specific statistic to compute. Default is 'max'. Options include 'max', 'min', 'mean', 'middle', '25 percentile', '75 percentile', '10 percentile', '90 percentile', '95 percentile', '99 percentile', and 'most'.

**Example Usage**

Suppose you are analyzing temperature data and need to find the maximum temperature recorded along with its corresponding datetime:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample DataFrame with datetime index and temperature data
idx = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=100, freq='D')
data = np.random.normal(20, 5, size=(100,))  # Simulated temperature data
df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=idx, columns=['Temperature'])

# Get the maximum temperature and its datetime
max_temp_date, max_temp = get_ts_statistic_value(df, 'max')
print(f"The maximum temperature was {max_temp}Â°C on {max_temp_date}")
```
