# flomo

`flomo` is a TUI/CLI for using the Flowtime Technique a.k.a. **Flowmodoro** Technique. It is a task execution helper, or in other words, productivity booster. `flomo` allows you to work on tasks in a flow state, track and manage your work/break time.

## Background

`flomo` was started as a Hackathon ([livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/xyqQgPEozv0)) on 6 June, 2024 with [@Jonak-Adipta-Kalita](https://github.com/Jonak-Adipta-Kalita) and [@AnubhavSC](https://github.com/AnubhavSC). We wanted to create a small scale project which was fun to make and possibly helped others as well. Moreover, we all are productivity fanatics. This is a project _heavily_ inspired by [pomo](https://github.com/kevinschoon/pomo).

And when we were 2 hours in, we realised that it was harder than we thought. We spent a lot of time debugging and refactoring. And we're still working on it.

## Flow and Flowtime Technique

[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) was known for his work on **Flow Theory**. He describes "flow" as[^1]:

> "A state of being in which people become so immersed in the joy of their work or activity 'that nothing else seems to matter.'"

And as developers/creators/romantics, we experience that state of "flow" often. This "flow" can **vary** at times, meaning that it can increase _or_ decrease.

This can easily be shown with a graph:

</p>

However, we can exploit that to our advantage and work efficiently, by finding the **right time** to take a break. And that right time is when the "flow" is depleting.
And this is called the Flowtime technique.

It works fairly simply:
**If you work for x amount of minutes, you should take a break for x/5 amount of minutes. And repeat.**

This calls for extensive amount of discipline. Which means that you must have at least some amount of natural focus. If not, I encourage you to check the Pomodoro Technique out.

## Installation

```bash
pip install flomodoro
```

### Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moiSentineL/flomo.git
cd flomo
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Known Issues

-   Skip doesn't work while on break (you can just make another session).
-   Might not work if you have attention span of a goldfish.

### Getting Started

Start a flow with tag "work" and "write some code" as session name:

```bash
flomo start -t work -n "write some code"
```

### Commands

```bash
flomo --help
	Usage: flomo [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    A Flowmodoro CLI for productivity enthusiasts.

	Options:
 		--help  Show this message and exit.

	Commands:
  		start (s)  Start a Flowmodoro session.
```

	init           initialises database
	track, t       track statistics
	config, cf     display current configuration
-->

## Roadmap

-   [x] Add sound on timer/stopwatch start
-   [x] Notification (only Linux for now)
-   [ ] Tracking data / time studied
-   [ ] Configure colors
