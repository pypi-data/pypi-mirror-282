## Typing stubs for openpyxl

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`openpyxl`](https://foss.heptapod.net/openpyxl/openpyxl) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`openpyxl`.

This version of `types-openpyxl` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `openpyxl==3.1.5`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/openpyxl. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `9fcaf3fe319f37246d2c065124045289d0ae4283` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.0, pyright 1.1.369, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
