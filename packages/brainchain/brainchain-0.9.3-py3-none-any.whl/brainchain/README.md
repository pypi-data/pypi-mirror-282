# brainchain.py
Client library for Brainchain Core Services (+ SalesIntel)

```pip install -e .```

or 


```python setup.py install``` 

both seem to work!
Then you can import the clients needed as follows:

```
[0] from brainchain import Brainchain, SalesIntel, FactCheck
[1] bc = Brainchain()
[2] answer = bc.summon("What is the current temperature in New York City?")
[3] print(answer)
 ==> { 
      'question': 'What is the current temperature in New York City?', 
      'answer': 'The current temperature in New York City is 72 degrees Fahrenheit.'
     }

[4] wrong_statement = bc.fact_check("The current humidity in Rockville MD is 99%")
[5] print(wrong_statement)
 ==> {
  "statement": "The current humidity in Rockville MD is 99%",
  "verdict": "Based on the information provided, the current weather report for Rockville, MD states that it is currently 73Â°F with partly cloudy skies. The humidity is 69.01% and there is no mention of a 99% humidity level. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement 'The current humidity in Rockville MD is 99%' is not accurate.",
  "score": 0,
