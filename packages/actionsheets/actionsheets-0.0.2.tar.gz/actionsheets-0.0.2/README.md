# actionsheets

A Python package that provides a large collection code snippets, and can render them in the form of _actionsheets_. Actionsheets are grouped look-up tables by action/intended outcome, and a code snippet to achieve it.
The package is intended for (new) developers to quickly look-up how to perform common actions for the given topic, but also contains some more advanced actions.

Actionsheets are printed in the console with coloring and syntax highlighting.
