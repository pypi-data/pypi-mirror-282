# Guidelines:
# - Schema names must start with the name of the survey. If the survey has more than one schema
#   the survey name should be followed by a "." and then a schema-specific specifier(s).
# - If a schema file is also being registered (path key), it is recommended that the file have the
#   same name (path stem) as the schema. Avro is the only file type currently implemented, and the file name
#   must end with ".avsc".
# - The path must be relative to the package directory or null if no schema file is being registered.
#

# # TEMPLATE
# # See the registry.Schemas docstring for an explanation of the fields.
