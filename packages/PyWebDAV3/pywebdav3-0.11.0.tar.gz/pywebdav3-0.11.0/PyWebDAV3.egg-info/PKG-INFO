PyWebDAV3
---------

PyWebDAV is a standards compliant WebDAV server and library written in Python

PyWebDAV3 is an updated distribution for python 3 support.

Python WebDAV implementation (level 1 and 2) that features a library that enables you
to integrate WebDAV server capabilities to your application

A fully working example on how to use the library is included. You can find the server in the DAVServer package. Upon installation a script called davserver is created in your $PYTHON/bin directory.

DETAILS
-------

Consists of a *server* that is ready to run
Serve and the DAV package that provides WebDAV server(!) functionality.

Currently supports

    * WebDAV level 1
    * Level 2 (LOCK, UNLOCK)
    * Experimental iterator support

It plays nice with

    * Mac OS X Finder
    * Windows Explorer
    * iCal
    * cadaver
    * Nautilus

This package does *not* provide client functionality.

INSTALLATION
------------

Installation and setup of server can be as easy as follows:

```sh
pip install PyWebDAV3
davserver -D /tmp -n -J
```

After installation of this package you will have a new script in you
$PYTHON/bin directory called *davserver*. This serves as the main entry point
to the server.

If you're living on the bleeding edge then check out the sourcecode from
https://github.com/andrewleech/PyWebDAV3

After having downloaded code simply install a development egg:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andrewleech/PyWebDAV3
cd PyWebDAV3
python setup.py develop
davserver --help
```

Any updates, fork and pull requests against my github page

If you want to use the library then have a look at the DAVServer package that
holds all code for a full blown server. Also doc/ARCHITECURE has information for you.
