    Find the beginning of a Zadoff-Chu sequence in data.

    This function finds the beginning and the end of a Zadoff-Chu sequence
    by computing the cross-correlation of the Zadoff-Chu sequence
    and the data.

    From version 0.4.27, the behavior of this function is a little different:

    first we find a first approximate of the Zadoff-Chu location by making
    a rolling average of the data, and then, we make the cross-correlation
    around this point.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): the data from where the Zadoff-Chu should be found.
        zc_root (int): the root of the Zadoff-Chu sequence.
        zc_length (int): the length of the Zadoff-Chu sequence.
        resample (float, optional): the optional resample to apply to the Zadoff-Chu sequence. Defaults to 1.
        ratio_approx (int, optional): the length of the data will be divided by this value to get the window size of the rolling average for the approximation. Defaults to 50.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int]: tuple including the beginning and the end of the Zadoff-Chu sequence.
