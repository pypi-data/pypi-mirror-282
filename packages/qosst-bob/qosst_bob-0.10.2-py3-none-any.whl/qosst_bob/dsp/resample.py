def _downsample_float(
    data: np.ndarray, start_point: int, downsampling_factor: float
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Downsample by a floating factor.

    Usually the operation is to take the point start_point + k * downsampling_factor.

    However, here downsampling_factor is a float so we want to compensate by approximating
    to the nearest integer with rint.

    Hence if L denotes the length of the list, the requirement on k is that

    rint(start_point + k * downsampling_factor) < L
    start_point+k*downsampling_factor <= L-0.5
    k <= (L-0.5-start_point)/downsampling_factor

    As k is an integer

    k <= np.floor((L-0.5-start_point)/downsampling_factor)

    As k must take this last value to recover everything the arange is
    np.arange(np.floor((L-0.5-start_point)/downsampling_factor) + 1)

    Note that the rint function was not used as its behavior is weird when being exactly between
    two integers (i.e. it rounds to the nearest integer value) which is hard to take into account for every possibility.

    Instead, we use np.ceil(x-0.5) that has the same behavior as np.rint except that is always round down when
    between exactly two values.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): the data to downsample.
        start_point (int): the start point: i.e. the first point in the downsample array is data[start_point].
