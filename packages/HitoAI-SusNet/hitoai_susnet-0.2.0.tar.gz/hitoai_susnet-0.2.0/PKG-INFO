# HitoAI_SusNet

HitoAI_SusNet is a machine learning project that uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict temperature based on various weather parameters. The project utilizes libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## Project Structure

- `preprocess_data(filepath, test_size)`: Preprocesses the data, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, scales features, and splits the data into training and testing sets.
- `train_model(X_train, y_train)`: Defines and trains the ANN model.
- `calculate_rmse(model, X_test, y_test)`: Calculates the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the model.
- `calculate_r2(model, X_test, y_test)`: Calculates the R-squared score of the model.
- `predict_temperature(model, X_test)`: Predicts the temperature using the trained model.
- `select_features(model, X_train, X_test, threshold)`: Selects important features based on the model's weights. default threshold=0.1

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shenaal1992/HitoAI_SusNet.git
    cd HitoAI_SusNet
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in a CSV file with columns: `temp`, `pressure`, `humidity`, `dew_point`, `clouds`, `wind_speed`, `wind_deg`, `weather_description`.

2. Import the necessary functions and preprocess your data:
    ```python
    from your_module import preprocess_data, train_model, calculate_rmse, calculate_r2, predict_temperature, select_features

    # Preprocess the data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data('path_to_your_file.csv', test_size=0.2)
    ```

3. Train the model:
    ```python
    model, history = train_model(X_train, y_train)
    ```

4. Evaluate the model:
    ```python
    rmse = calculate_rmse(model, X_test, y_test)
    r2 = calculate_r2(model, X_test, y_test)

    print(f"RMSE: {rmse}")
    print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
    ```

5. Make predictions:
    ```python
    y_pred = predict_temperature(model, X_test)
    ```

6. Select important features:
    ```python
    X_train_selected, X_test_selected, selected_features = select_features(model, X_train, X_test, threshold=0.1)
    ```
