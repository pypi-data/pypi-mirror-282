Installation
------------

End-user installation
*********************

The package is written in pure python and is installable via pip.
Optional dependencies (see further down) can be added to provide more functionality:
built-in compatibility with common RL libraries, visualization tools, ...

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv)$ pip install amaze-benchmarker

.. warning::

    Unfortunately the name `amaze` is already taken by another project on PyPI.
    Thus the correct package name is `amaze-benchmarker`, the import still
    reference the library by its short name (e.g. `import amaze` and not
    `import amaze-benchmarker`)


Tutorials
---------

The reader is first encouraged to play around with the main executable (:mod:`amaze.bin.main`).
Without arguments, it will provide an interface where one can manipulate a maze and control an
agent via the keyboard.

.. code-block:: console

    (.venv)$ amaze
