 A number is expressed as a product of a coefficient and a power of ten. 
 
 Example: 2360 is written in scientific notation as 2.36 x 10^3
 
 Here 2.36 is called the coeficient and 10^3 is the value raised to the power of 10.
 
 Number of places the decimal point is shifted indicates the numerical value of power 10.
 
 If the shift is to the left, the exponent to the 10 is positive
 If the shift is to the right, the exponent to the 10 is negative

 A number is expressed as a product of a coefficient and a power of ten. 
 
 Example: 2360 is written in scientific notation as 2.36 x 10^3
 
 Here 2.36 is called the coeficient and 10^3 is the value raised to the power of 10.
 
 Number of places the decimal point is shifted indicates the numerical value of power 10.
 
 If the shift is to the left, the exponent to the 10 is positive
 If the shift is to the right, the exponent to the 10 is negative

 If the numbers have the same number of digits, compare the numbers in each place value starting with the highest. 
 Since the number of digits are the same, compare the hundred thousands place.
 423,222 is the highest.

 A number is expressed as a product of a coefficient and a power of ten. 
 
 Example: 2360 is written in scientific notation as 2.36 x 10^3
 
 Here 2.36 is called the coeficient and 10^3 is the value raised to the power of 10.
 
 Number of places the decimal point is shifted indicates the numerical value of power 10.
 
 If the shift is to the left, the exponent to the 10 is positive

 A number is expressed as a product of a coefficient and a power of ten. 
 
 Example: 2360 is written in scientific notation as 2.36 x 10^3
 
 Here 2.36 is called the coeficient and 10^3 is the value raised to the power of 10.
 
 Number of places the decimal point is shifted indicates the numerical value of power 10.
 
 If the shift is to the left, the exponent to the 10 is positive
 If the shift is to the right, the exponent to the 10 is negative

 The probability of such events are called as compound probabilities.
 
 Compound probability is the multiplication of the individual probabilities of the events when two events are independent of each other.
 
 The probability of each event is calculated and then all the probabilities are multiplied with each other.
 
 Example:
 Ques: What is the probability that I throw a 6 and then a 4 with a die? 
 Hint: In a dice, each of the 6 numbers are independent and have a probability of 1/6 each.
 
 Probability of throwing a 6 = 1/6
 Probability of throwing a 4 = 1/6
