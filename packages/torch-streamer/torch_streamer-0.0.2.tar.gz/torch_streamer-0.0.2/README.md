## Usage

### Install with pip
```bash
pip install torch-streamer
```

### Documentation

Docs are available at
[torch-streamer.readthedocs.io](https://torch-streamer.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

## Development

### Setup
The following script creates a virtual environment using
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for the project and installs
dependencies with [uv](https://pypi.org/project/uv/).

```bash
pyenv install 3.10
pyenv virtualenv 3.10 torch-streamer
bin/deps
```

You can also use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) with the project to
run tests, etc. at commit time.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Testing
Testing, formatting, and static checking can all be done with pre-commit at
any time.

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

There is also a watcher script that can be used to run these whenever a file
changes.

```bash
bin/watch
```

### Documentation
The project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with
[mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/python/) for documentation, and
you can start a mkdocs web server to test/edit documentation as follows.

```bash
bin/docserve
```

Documentation is hosted by
[Read the Docs](https://torch-streamer.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and will
automatically update when the main branch is merged.

### Releasing
The library can be updated on the main PyPI repository as follows.

```bash
bin/release pypi
```

If needed, you can release to the test PyPI repository with this command.

```
bin/release pypi-test
```
