## Introduction

**PickForMe** is a command-line tool designed to help users make decisions when faced with multiple options. Whether you're deciding on a place to visit, a sport to play, or a restaurant to dine at, PickForMe assists in managing and selecting from your list of choices.

The tool organizes options into a three-layer hierarchy:
1. **Groups**: Representing different contexts or teams.
2. **Categories**: Representing types of activities within a group.
3. **Activities**: Representing specific options or entries within a category.

## Features

- **Three-layer hierarchy**: Organize your options into groups, categories, and activities.
- **Soft Deletion**: Mark records as deleted without permanently removing them.
