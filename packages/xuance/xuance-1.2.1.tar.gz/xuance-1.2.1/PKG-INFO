XuanCe is an open-source ensemble of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm implementations. We call it as Xuan-Ce (玄策) in Chinese. "Xuan (玄)" means incredible and magic box, "Ce (策)" means policy. DRL algorithms are sensitive to hyper-parameters tuning, varying in performance with different tricks, and suffering from unstable training processes, therefore, sometimes DRL algorithms seems elusive and "Xuan". This project gives a thorough, high-quality and easy-to-understand implementation of DRL algorithms, and hope this implementation can give a hint on the magics of reinforcement learning. We expect it to be compatible with multiple deep learning toolboxes( PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MindSpore), and hope it can really become a zoo full of DRL algorithms.
