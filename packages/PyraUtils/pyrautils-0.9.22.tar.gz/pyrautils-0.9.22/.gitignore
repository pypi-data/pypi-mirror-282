# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# These are some examples of commonly ignored file patterns.
# You should customize this list as applicable to your project.
