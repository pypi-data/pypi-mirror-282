# Genomics Product Python SDK

[![release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.0.0-orange.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.0.0-orange.svg)

The Genomics Product Python SDK is the easiest way for Python developers to build with the Genomics Product API. 
The Genomics Product API gives you access to Genomics models created by [Instadeep](https://www.instadeep.com/).

## Get started with the Genomics Product API
1. Go to [Genomics Product web application](https://genomics.prduct.instadeep.com/).
2. Login with to your account.
3. [Create](https://genomics.prduct.instadeep.com/apikey) an API key.

## Usage example
Genomics Product SDK can be installed from the [github repository](https://github.com/instadeepai/genomics-product-sdk):
```sh
git clone git@github.com:instadeepai/genomics-product-sdk.git

# for Linux users run this in the repo folder
python -m pip install --user .

#for Windows users run CMD as administrator, navigate to project folder and run this command
 python -m pip install .
```
Add these environment variables 
```yaml
API_KEY="***************" //fetch this from the app ui
BACKEND_URL=https://api-dev.genomics-product.deepchain.bio/api/v1
```


Please note, this approach requires that the installing user has the necessary [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to access
the Git repository.

Please authorize the key to work with your organization, so it can access the repo within.

### Usage
* To get the list of models run this command line:
```sh
genomics models
```
* Triggering the inference can be run from the command line:
```sh
genomics run -I input_file -O output_file -A gene-expression -M 018f3852-4a0b-96e1-8320-d00e81032b3c -N Job_20 --wait
```

Required parameters:
 - ```-I```: Input fasta file path.
 - ```-O```: Output file path.
 - ```-M```: ID of the model version.
 - ```-A```: Genomics task the NT is trained to perform.

Optional parameters:
 - ```-N```: The user-provided name for the job, used for identification and tracking. (default: auto-generated unique job name, combining a prefix, UUID, and timestamp).
 - ```--wait```: Wait for the job run result if this flag is present.
