    Although the class offers methods and behaviour similar to that of a set,
    the actual construction of the set using Blocks happens via an operation stack which gets
    resolved during a normalisation process.

    In normalized form all the resulting blocks are disjoint.

    The normalisation process resolves overlapping and redundancy such that
    any 2 sets of equal content (i.e. the same set of points) will have the same
    representation in terms of the blocks used to represent the space.

    Methods and operators mirror those of the native set class
    - Modify the content (add, remove, toggle)
    - Compare (equality, subset, superset)
    - Compare operations (intersection, union, difference)

    There is some extra validation some methods to ensure
    the supplied arguments are, or can be interpreted as a Block/BlockSet
    and match the dimension of the current content.

    Normalisation is required and important (for accurate comparisons) but also costly.
    We only want to perform it when its absolutely necessary and so clients are advised
    to group together modification calls as much as possible in order to minimise the amount
    of normalising required and especially so if performance is of a significant concern.
