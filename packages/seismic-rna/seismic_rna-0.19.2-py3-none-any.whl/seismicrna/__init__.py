Expose the sub-packages ``demult``, ``align``, ``relate``, ``cluster``,
and ``table``, plus the ``__version__`` attribute, at the top level so
that they can be imported from external modules and scripts::

    >>> import seismicrna
    >>> seismicrna.__version__
    'x.y.z'
    >>> from seismicrna import __version__
    'x.y.z'

from . import demult, align, relate, cluster, table, cleanfa
from .core.version import __version__
