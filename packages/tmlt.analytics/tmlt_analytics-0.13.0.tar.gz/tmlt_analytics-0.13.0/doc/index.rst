Tumult Analytics is a Python library for computing aggregate queries on tabular
data using differential privacy.

Tumult Analytics is…

- … *easy to use*: its interface will seem familiar to anyone with prior
  experience with tools like SQL or
  `PySpark <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/>`__.
- … *feature-rich*: it supports a large and ever-growing list of aggregation
  functions, data transformation operators, and privacy definitions.
- … *robust*: it is built and maintained by a team of differential privacy
  experts, and runs in production at institutions like the U.S. Census Bureau.
- … *scalable*: it runs on `Spark <http://spark.apache.org>`__, so it can scale
  to very large datasets.

For new users, `this Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18J_UrHAKJf52RMRxi4OOpk59dV9tvKxO#offline=true&sandboxMode=true>`__ demonstrates basic features of the library without requiring a local installation.
To explore further, start with the :ref:`installation instructions <installation instructions>`, then follow our :ref:`tutorial series <First steps>`.

If you have any questions, feedback, or feature requests, please `let us know on Slack <https://tmlt.dev/slack>`__!
