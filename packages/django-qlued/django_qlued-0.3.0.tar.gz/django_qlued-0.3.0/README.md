# django-qlued

A django package the couples together quantum hardware and endusers. It allows cold atom hardware and simulators to be accessed through the `qiskit-cold-atom` and the `sqooler` SDK:

- `qlued` handles the user management and stores the received *json* file in an appropiate queue.
- `qiskit-cold-atom` allows the enduser to write the circuit definitions on its laptop and send them to the server in form of a nice *json* file.
- `sqooler` acts as the SDK that pulls the the calculations from the queue and sends back the result into the storage.
- end devices like the [sqooler-example](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/sqooler-example) or the [labscript-qc-example](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/labscript-qc-example) can perform the calculation and display it to the user.

## Getting started

You can currently install the package via pip through:

```
pip install django-qlued
```

We provide a template for a simple startup:

- The fully deployable example is accessible via [qlued](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/qlued).
- Examples for configurations can be found in the `tests` folder.
