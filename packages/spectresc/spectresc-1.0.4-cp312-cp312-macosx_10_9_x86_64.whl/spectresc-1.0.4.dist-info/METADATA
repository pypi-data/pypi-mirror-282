This is a Python package written with C extension to provide significant performance gain on [SpectRes](https://github.com/ACCarnall/SpectRes), and some performance over the numba implementation:

We keep the implementation as close to SpectRes as possible. As of SpectRes v2.2.0, we do not see discrepant results between using SpectRes and SpectResC.

## Installation

SpectResC can be installed using pip

```
pip install spectresc
```
