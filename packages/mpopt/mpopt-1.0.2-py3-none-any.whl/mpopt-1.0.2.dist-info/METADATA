MPOPT
=====

*MPOPT* is an open-source, extensible, customizable and easy
to use python package that includes a collection of modules to solve
multi-stage non-linear optimal control problems(OCP) using
pseudo-spectral collocation methods.

The package uses collocation methods to construct a Nonlinear programming problem (NLP) representation of OCP. The resulting NLP is then solved by algorithmic differentiation based [CasADi nlpsolver](https://casadi.sourceforge.net/v3.3.0/api/html/d4/d89/group__nlpsol.html)
( NLP solver supports multiple solver plugins including
[IPOPT](https://casadi.sourceforge.net/v3.3.0/api/html/d4/d89/group__nlpsol.html#plugin_Nlpsol_ipopt),
[SNOPT](https://casadi.sourceforge.net/v3.3.0/api/html/d4/d89/group__nlpsol.html#plugin_Nlpsol_snopt),
[sqpmethod](https://casadi.sourceforge.net/v3.3.0/api/html/d4/d89/group__nlpsol.html#plugin_Nlpsol_sqpmethod),
[scpgen](https://casadi.sourceforge.net/v3.3.0/api/html/d4/d89/group__nlpsol.html#plugin_Nlpsol_scpgen)).

Main features of the package are :

-   Customizable collocation approximation, compatible with
    Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR), Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL),
    Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto (CGL) roots.
-   Intuitive definition of single/multi-phase OCP.
-   Supports Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs).
-   Customized adaptive grid refinement schemes (Extendable)
-   Gaussian quadrature and differentiation matrices are evaluated using algorithmic differentiation, thus, supporting arbitrarily high number of collocation points limited only by the computational resources.
-   Intuitive post-processing module to retrieve and visualize the solution
-   Good test coverage of the overall package
-   Active development

Quick start
----------------

-   Install from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/mpopt/) repository using the following terminal command, then copy paste the code from example below in a file (test.py) and run (python3 test.py) to confirm the installation.

```bash
pip install mpopt
```

-   (OR) Build directly from source (Terminal). Finally, `make run` to solve the moon-lander example described below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mpopt/mpopt.git --branch master
cd mpopt
make build
make run
source env/bin/activate
```

**OCP** :
> Find optimal path, i.e Height ( $x_0$ ), Velocity ( $x_1$ ) and Throttle ( $u$ ) to reach the surface: Height (0m), Velocity (0m/s) from: Height (10m) and velocity(-2m/s) with: minimum fuel (u).

$$\begin{aligned}
&\min_{x, u}        & \qquad & J = 0 + \int_{t_0}^{t_f}u\ dt\\
&\text{subject to} &      & \dot{x_0} = x_1; \dot{x_1} = u - 1.5\\
 &                 &     & x_0(t_f) = 0; \ x_1(t_f) = 0\\
&                  &      & x_0(t_0) = 10; \ x_1(t_0) = -2\\
&                  &       & x_0 \geq 0; 0 \leq u \leq 3\\
&                 &     & t_0 = 0.0; t_f = \text{free variable}
\end{aligned}$$

```python
# Moon lander OCP direct collocation/multi-segment collocation

# from context import mpopt # (Uncomment if running from source)
from mpopt import mp

# Define OCP
ocp = mp.OCP(n_states=2, n_controls=1)
ocp.dynamics[0] = lambda x, u, t: [x[1], u[0] - 1.5]
ocp.running_costs[0] = lambda x, u, t: u[0]
ocp.terminal_constraints[0] = lambda xf, tf, x0, t0: [xf[0], xf[1]]
ocp.x00[0] = [10.0, -2.0]
ocp.lbu[0], ocp.ubu[0] = 0, 3
ocp.lbx[0][0] = 0

# Create optimizer(mpo), solve and post process(post) the solution
mpo, post = mp.solve(ocp, n_segments=20, poly_orders=3, scheme="LGR", plot=True)
x, u, t, _ = post.get_data()
mp.plt.show()
```

Case studies
--------------

-   Quick demo of the solver using simple moon-lander fuel minimization
    OCP (bang-bang type control), refer [Quick features demo
    notebook](docs/source/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb) for more details. The
    image below shows the optimal altitude and the velocity profile
    (states) along with the optimal throttle (controls) to get minimum
    fuel trajectory to land on the Moon.

![image](docs/source/_static/ml_adaptive.png)

-   A complex real-world example of The SpaceX falcon9 rocket orbital
    launch with the booster recovery results are shown below. OCP is
    defined to find the optimal trajectory and the thrust profile for
    booster return, refer [SpaceX Falcon9 booster recovery
    notebook](docs/source/notebooks/falcon9_to_orbit.ipynb) for more details. The
    first image below is the MPOPT solution using adaptive mesh and the
    second one is the real-time data of the SpaceX Falcon9 launch of
    NROL76 mission. The ballistic altitude profile of the booster is
    evident in both MPOPT solution and the real-time telemetry. Further,
    the MPOPT velocity solution compares well with the real-time data
    even though the formulation is only a first order representation of
    the actual booster recovery problem.

Features and Limitations
---------------------------
While MPOPT is able to solve any Optimal control problem formulation in the Bolza form, the present limitations of MPOPT are,

- Only continuous functions and derivatives are supported
- Dynamics and constraints are to be written in CasADi variables (Familiarity with casadi variables and expressions is expected)
- The adaptive grid though successful in generating robust solutions for simple problems, doesn't have a concrete proof on convergence.
