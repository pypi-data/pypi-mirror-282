# LilTorch

![Logo](documentation/docs/images/logo-torch.png)

LilTorch is a lightweight library for Deep Learning, created entirely in Python with Numpy as its sole dependency.
This library allows you to design and understand the internals of Neural Networks without the need for C/C++ imported code and binaries.
Everything is as understandable as Python itself.

**Note**: This library is intended for educational purposes only. It is not recommended for production use, and execution speed is not a primary focus.
