## Description

Hydrogram is a Python library for interacting with the Telegram MTProto API. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for developers to leverage the power of Telegram's API in their Python applications.

## Installation

To install Hydrogram, you need Python 3 installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website.

To install Hydrogram, use pip:

```bash
pip install hydrogram -U
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use Hydrogram:

```python
from hydrogram import Client, filters

app = Client("my_account")


@app.on_message(filters.private)
async def hello(client, message):
    await message.reply("Hello from Hydrogram!")


app.run()
```

## Features

- **Easy to use:** Hydrogram provides a simple and intuitive interface for developers to leverage the power of Telegram's API in their Python applications, while still allowing advanced usages.
- **Elegant:** Low-level details are abstracted and re-presented in a more convenient way, making the Telegram API more accessible.
- **Fast:** Hydrogram is boosted by [TgCrypto](https://github.com/pyrogram/tgcrypto), a high-performance cryptography library written in C, which makes it faster than other Python Telegram libraries.
- **Type-hinted:** Types and methods are all type-hinted, enabling excellent editor support and making it easier to write and maintain code.
- **Async:** Hydrogram is fully asynchronous, which means it can handle multiple requests at the same time, making it faster and more efficient.
- **Powerful:** Hydrogram provides full access to Telegram's API to execute any official client action and more, giving developers the flexibility to build powerful applications.
