        """Get up to date information about a chat.

        Information include current name of the user for one-on-one conversations, current username of a user, group or
        channel, etc.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                Unique identifier for the target chat in form of a *t.me/joinchat/* link, identifier (int) or username
                of the target channel/supergroup (in the format @username).

        Returns:
            :obj:`~hydrogram.types.Chat` | :obj:`~hydrogram.types.ChatPreview`: On success, if you've already joined the chat, a chat object is returned,
            otherwise, a chat preview object is returned.

        Raises:
            ValueError: In case the chat invite link points to a chat you haven't joined yet.

        Example:
