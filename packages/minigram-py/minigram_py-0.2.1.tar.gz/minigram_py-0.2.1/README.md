## Installation 📦

To start building your super cool Telegram bot with MiniGram, simply install it using pip:

```
pip install minigram-py
```

## Usage 🚀

Using MiniGram is as easy as 1-2-3! Here are a few examples to get you started:

### Basic Example

```python
from minigram import MiniGram

class MyAwesomeBot(MiniGram):
    def incoming(self, msg):
        if msg.text == "/start":
            return msg.reply("Welcome to my awesome bot! 🎉")
        self.send_text(msg.chat_id, "I don't understand that command. 😕")

    def edited(self, msg):
        return msg.reply("I see you edited the message!")

bot = MyAwesomeBot("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
bot.start_polling()
```

In just a few lines of code, you've created a bot that responds to the "/start" command. How cool is that? 😎

### Starlette Integration

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Route
from minigram import StarletteMiniGram

class MyStarletteBot(StarletteMiniGram):
    async def incoming(self, msg):
        if msg.text == "/hello":
            return msg.reply("Hello from Starlette! 👋")

bot = MyStarletteBot("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
bot.set_webhook("https://yourwebsite.com/webhook")

app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=[
    Route("/webhook", bot.starlette_handler, methods=["POST"]),
])
```

This example shows how seamlessly MiniGram integrates with Starlette, allowing you to create a webhook endpoint for your bot in no time! 🌐

### Asynchronous Mode

```python
import asyncio
from minigram import AsyncMiniGram

class MyAsyncBot(AsyncMiniGram):
    async def incoming(self, msg):
        if msg.text == "/sync":
            return msg.reply("I'm a asynchronous bot, for sure! ⚙️")

    async def edited(self, msg):
        return msg.reply("I see you edited the message!")

async def main():
    bot = MyAsyncBot("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
    await bot.send_text(YOUR_CHAT_ID, "Hello from an asynchronous bot! 🚀")
    await bot.start_polling()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

MiniGram works just as well in asynchronous mode, making it easy to integrate with your existing async application. 🎛️
