`xlmhg` is an efficient Python/Cython implementation of the semiparametric
`XL-mHG test`__ for enrichment in ranked lists. The XL-mHG test is an extension
of the nonparametric `mHG test`__, which was developed by `Dr. Zohar
Yakhini`__ and colleagues.

`xlmhglite` is a fork of the original `xlmhg` package (which is unfortunately no longer being maintained).
This fork was updated to support modern Python versions (Python >=3.8), fix bugs in the original implementation,
and reduce the mandatory dependencies of the project to a minimum.
To that end, the plotting functionality of `xlmhg` is not part of the core `xlmhglite` package, instead being an optional requirement.

Installation
------------

To install the core ("lite") version of `xlmhglite`:
.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install xlmhglite

To install the complete version of `xlmhglite` (including the plotting functionality):
.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install xlmhglite['all']

Getting started
---------------

The `xlmhglite` package provides two functions (one simple and more more advanced)
for performing XL-mHG tests. These functions are documented in the
`User Manual`__. Here's a quick example using the "simple" test function:

.. code-block:: python

    import xlmhglite
    stat, cutoff, pval = xlmhglite.xlmhg_test(v, X, L)

Where: ``v`` is the ranked list of 0's and 1's, represented by a NumPy array of
integers, ``X`` and ``L`` are the XL-mHG parameters, and the return values have
the following meanings:

- ``stat``: The XL-mHG test statistic
- ``cutoff``: The cutoff at which XL-mHG test statistic was attained
- ``pval``: The XL-mHG p-value

Comput Biol, 2007)`__ and `Wagner (PLoS One, 2015)`__.

History
=======



1.1.1 (2024-06-30)
------------------
xlmhglite now runs on numpy version 2 and above.

1.1.0 (2023-06-11)
------------------
This version improves clarity of warning messages and addresses some additional bugs.
Moreover, the project has been transitioned to use pyproject.toml and setup.cfg, and old code was cleaned up for better maintainability.

Changed
********
* Warning messages regarding failed import of the cython module were made more informative.
* Transitioned the project to use pyproject.toml and setup.cfg, and cleaned up legacy code from setup.py.

Fixed
******
* Fixed bug where calculating enrichment scores using the pure Python implementation would raise an AttributeError.
* Fixed bug where the pure Python implementation would raise an ImportError if numba is not already installed on the system.

1.0.1 (2023-06-11)
------------------
Minor patch addressing installation issues.

1.0.0 (2023-06-10)
------------------
First stable release.
