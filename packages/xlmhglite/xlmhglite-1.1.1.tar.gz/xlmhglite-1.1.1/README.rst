`xlmhg` is an efficient Python/Cython implementation of the semiparametric
`XL-mHG test`__ for enrichment in ranked lists. The XL-mHG test is an extension
of the nonparametric `mHG test`__, which was developed by `Dr. Zohar
Yakhini`__ and colleagues.

`xlmhglite` is a fork of the original `xlmhg` package (which is unfortunately no longer being maintained).
This fork was updated to support modern Python versions (Python >=3.8), fix bugs in the original implementation,
and reduce the mandatory dependencies of the project to a minimum.
To that end, the plotting functionality of `xlmhg` is not part of the core `xlmhglite` package, instead being an optional requirement.

Installation
------------

To install the core ("lite") version of `xlmhglite`:
.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install xlmhglite

To install the complete version of `xlmhglite` (including the plotting functionality):
.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install xlmhglite['all']

Getting started
---------------

The `xlmhglite` package provides two functions (one simple and more more advanced)
for performing XL-mHG tests. These functions are documented in the
`User Manual`__. Here's a quick example using the "simple" test function:

.. code-block:: python

    import xlmhglite
    stat, cutoff, pval = xlmhglite.xlmhg_test(v, X, L)

Where: ``v`` is the ranked list of 0's and 1's, represented by a NumPy array of
integers, ``X`` and ``L`` are the XL-mHG parameters, and the return values have
the following meanings:

- ``stat``: The XL-mHG test statistic
- ``cutoff``: The cutoff at which XL-mHG test statistic was attained
- ``pval``: The XL-mHG p-value

Comput Biol, 2007)`__ and `Wagner (PLoS One, 2015)`__.
