inigrep is designed to read a particular simplistic dialect of
INI configuration files.  In a sense, it can be considered as
a "grep for INIs", in that rather than parsing the file into
a typed memory structure for later access, it passes file each
time a query is done, and spits out relevant parts; treating
everything as text.  Hence, it's not intended as replacement
for a full-blown configuration system but rather a quick & dirty
"swiss axe" for quick & dirty scripts.
