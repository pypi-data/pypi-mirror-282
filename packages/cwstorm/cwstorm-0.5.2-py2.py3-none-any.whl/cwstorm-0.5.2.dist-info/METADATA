# Storm

Storm is a Python DSL to generate a graph of task dependencies.

## Install

For development, it's best to install in *editable* mode in a virtual environment. 


```
> git clone git@github.com/ConductorTechnologies/cwstorm.git
> cd cwstorm

# Create a virtual environment
> python3 -m venv cwstorm.venv
> . cwstorm.venv/bin/activate

# Install in editable mode
> pip install -e .

# Optionally install the black formatter and some other dev tools
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start CLI

### Serialize

Use the `storm` CLI command to serialize one of the example jobs. The pretty option generates human readable JSON output. The filename will be the same as the example but with a `.json` extension, and will be placed in the folder you specify.

```
> storm serialize -x simple_qt -f pretty ~/Desktop/graphs/
> cat ~/Desktop//graphs/simple_qt.json
```

### Validate

Validate a JSON file with the `validate` subcommand.

```
> storm validate /path/to/my_graph.json
```

You'll see a report in a browser window.

You can output the report to markdown if you prefer. Here's an example [validation report](./VALIDATION_EXAMPLE.md)

In order to validate a graph, the `storm` command loads the JSON file into a dict, and then uses the DSL to reconstruct the graph. The code to reconstruct the graph from a dict is in `deserializer.py`. 

You can bypass the validation and pass a dict directly to the deserializer to get a job.
```
from cwstorm.deserializer import deserialize

with open(infile, "r", encoding="utf-8") as fh:
    data = json.load(fh)
  
job = deserialize(data)

print("name", job.name())
print("comment", job.comment())
print("num_tasks", job.count_descendents())
```

## Visualize

You can visualize graphs in the desktop app: https://github.com/ConductorTechnologies/cioapp

Once the app is running you can send a workflow through it's HTTP server which runs on port 3031. 

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3031/graph -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @/path/to/my_graph.json 
```

### Command-line interface

The command-line interface has several subcommands, 
* `schema`     Display the schema.
* `serialize`  Serialize a job to json.
* `validate`   Validate a JSON file.


```
storm serialize --help
```

### Examples

The `ass_comp_normal.py` example is a more complex script. It builds a graph of tasks that uploads assets, generates ass files, renders them, adds optical motion blur, makes a quicktime, and notifies people.

## DSL Structure

A graph consists of dag nodes with attributes. Look through the examples folder to familiarize yourself with the API. All classes derive from Node.

### Node 
The base class. Responsible for generating getters and setters for different attributes. The idea is to have a consistent language to build the DAG, add options to nodes, and to quickly see how the graph will look. See the ATTRS lists in Job, Task, Upload, and Cmd. The types of attributes that can be added to nodes are:
  * bool
  * int
  * str
  * dict
  * Cmd
  * list of int
  * list of str
  * list of Cmd
  * list of dict

Setters return self, which allows for chaining.

Getters and setters are generated are as follows for Attribute name `atr` of Node `n`:

`bool`

* Setter: `n.atr(value) -> self`
* Getter  `n.atr() -> int`

`int`  

* Setter: `n.atr(value) -> self`
* Getter  `n.atr() -> int`


`str`  

* Setter: `n.atr(value) -> self`
* Getter  `n.atr() -> str`


`dict`  

* Setter: `n.atr({"key": "VAL", ...}) -> self`
* Updater  `n.update_atr({"key2": "VAL2", ...}) -> self`
* Getter  `n.atr() -> dict`

`Cmd`

* Setter: `n.atr(Cmd(*args)) -> self`
* Getter  `n.atr() -> Cmd`

`list:int`

* Setter: `n.atr(*args) -> self`
* Extender  `n.push_atr(*args) -> self`
* Getter  `n.atr() -> list of int`

`list:str`

* Setter: `n.atr(*args) -> self`
* Extender  `n.push_atr(*args) -> self`
* Getter  `n.atr() -> list of str`


`list:Cmd`

* Setter: `n.atr(Cmd(*args), Cmd(*args), ...) -> self`
* Extender  `n.push_atr(Cmd(*args), Cmd(*args), ...) -> self`
* Getter  `n.atr() -> list of Cmd`

`list:dict`

* Setter: `n.atr({"key": "VAL", ...}, {"key": "VAL", ...}, ...) -> self`
* Extender  `n.push_atr({"key": "VAL", ...}, {"key": "VAL", ...}, ...) -> self`
* Getter  `n.atr() -> list of dict`
