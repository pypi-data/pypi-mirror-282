This module contains a comprehensive and organized list of Indigenous land claims and lawsuits against Canada, both historical and active.

## Overview

Indigenous land claims and lawsuits in Canada seek to address wrongs made against Indigenous peoples, their rights, and lands by the federal, provincial, or territorial governments. These claims are categorized into two main types:

1. **Comprehensive Claims**: These involve Indigenous rights based on traditional use and occupancy of land by Indigenous peoples who did not sign treaties. Settlements typically include terms such as money, land, self-government rights, and joint management of lands and resources.

2. **Specific Claims**: These arise from issues related to the administration of treaties, the Indian Act, and the unlawful use of reserve lands. Settlements usually involve compensation and land.
