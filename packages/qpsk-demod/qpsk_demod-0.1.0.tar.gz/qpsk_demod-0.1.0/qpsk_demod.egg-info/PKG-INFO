# qpsk_demod

Perform Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) demodulation on the received signal.

    Parameters:
    r (array-like): The received modulated signal.
    fc (float): Carrier frequency.
    of (int): Oversampling factor, determining the number of samples per symbol.

    Returns:
    tuple:
        a_hat (numpy.ndarray): The estimated binary data stream.
        x (numpy.ndarray): The demodulated in-phase component.
        y (numpy.ndarray): The demodulated quadrature component.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Demodulates the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components from the received signal.
    2. Applies a low-pass filter to extract the baseband signal.
    3. Downsamples the filtered signals to the symbol rate.
    4. Estimates the binary data stream by thresholding the demodulated signals.

    Example:
    >>>import qpsk_demod as qd
    >>> r = np.array([0.5, -0.5, 1.0, -1.0, 0.5, -0.5, -1.0, 1.0])
    >>> fc = 100
    >>> of = 4
    >>> a_hat, x, y = qd.qpsk_demod(r, fc, of)

## Installation

```sh
pip install qpsk-demod
