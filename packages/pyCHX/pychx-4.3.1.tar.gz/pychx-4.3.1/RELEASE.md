Steps for releasing a version of pyCHX


* Make sure that you have an up-to-date copy of the master branch.
* Make an empty commit to serve as a marker in the history. This is technically
  optional, but it is nice to do. ``git commit --allow-empty -m "REL: v0.0.1"``
* Now make the tag. This should never be delete, so make sure you are certain.
  ``git tag v0.0.1``
* Push the commit up to github: ``git push upstream master``
* Push the tag also: ``git push upstream v0.0.1``
