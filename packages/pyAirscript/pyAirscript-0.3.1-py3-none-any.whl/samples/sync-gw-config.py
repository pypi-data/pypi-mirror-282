"""
Sync the config across Airlock Gateways in active/active mode

Usage: airscript sync-gw-config.py <origin | group>

If an origin node is specified, its configuration is sync'ed to the other nodes in the same group.
Ohterwise, the most recent config of all nodes in the same group is used.
Groups are defined in AirScript configuration file, by default ~/.airscript/config.yaml
