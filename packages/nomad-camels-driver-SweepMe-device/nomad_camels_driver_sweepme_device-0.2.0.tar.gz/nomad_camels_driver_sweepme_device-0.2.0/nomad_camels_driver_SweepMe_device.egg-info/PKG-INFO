## Usage

To use this wrapper, you need to install the drivers of SweepMe! seperately. You can find them on their [website](https://sweep-me.net/devices) or get them from their [GitHub page](https://github.com/SweepMe/instrument-drivers).

Please note that this provides only a wrapper for the drivers of SweepMe! and may not support all functions. If you find any issues, please feel free to [report an issue](https://github.com/FAU-LAP/CAMELS_drivers/issues).

The single drivers might need additional python packages. Those are not required by this package! Please make sure you have the appropriate libraries for the instrument you want to use.
