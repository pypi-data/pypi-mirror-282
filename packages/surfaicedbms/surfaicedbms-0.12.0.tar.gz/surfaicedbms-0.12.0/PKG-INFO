# Notes
This PyPi package is prepared for test reasons. Due to the storage limitations of PyPi, the files necessary for installation of CAM Setup and the Machine used in CAM setup are here not included.
The original package can be accessed over following link:
https://git.ift.tuwien.ac.at/lab/ift/sis/projects/surfaice/surfaice-dbms.git
Branch: surfaicedbms-mr-json

# Decription

This software is designed to store, analyze, import, and export available data in the context of “surfaice” project. Supplied data has a heterogenous nature as it consists of:
 - Unstructured data types with pdf or prt extensions. For these types of data, it is not possible to be processed by conventional tools, due to the lack of their predefined model.
 - Semi-structured data types such as JSON, which provide a flexible data model as it doesn’t force for a rigid data structure. 
 - Structured data as data frames or any table-based components, where the data is organized into columns and rows.
surfaicedbms handles the storage of this heterogenous data by saving unstructured and semi-structured data into a NoSQL database and, the structured data to a conventional database.
With conventional database higher validation and transaction safety have been achieved by using trigger functions and constraints as primary or foreign keys.
Additionally, for handling the time-series an extension to the conventional database PostgreSQL the TimescaleDB has been used to access its additional functionalities as continuous aggregates.

# Software Architecture

surfaicedbms consist of three different layers:
- Database layer includes on the one hand storage units in available Mongo DB and PostgreSQL connections such as tables, views, collections or documents, on the other hand further functionalities
such as functions, triggers and constraints to perform efficient management of a certain data model.
- API layer includes classes, which are relevant for providing methods for generating processing data, as well as methods used for sending read, write, update or delete requests to the databases.
- Application layer includes workflows both for data acquisition of a workpiece data model from different phases of product life cycle, and data analysis from acquired data.
