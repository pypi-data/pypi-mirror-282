class ECSFargate(AWSService):
    """A service hosted on AWS ECS Fargate.

    Like all [Services](/docs/concepts/services), this class configures itself across multiple [Environments](/docs/concepts/environments).

    For more information see [the official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html).


    ## Example Usage
    ```python
    import launchflow as lf

    # Automatically creates / connects to an ECS Fargate Service in your AWS account
    service = lf.aws.ECSFargate("my-service")
    ```

    **NOTE:** This will create the following infrastructure in your AWS account:
    - A [ECS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) service with the specified configuration.
    - An [Application Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing) to route traffic to the service.
    - A [Code Build](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild) project that builds and deploys Docker images for the service.
    - An [Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr) repository to store the service's Docker image.
