# Hybrid

Python functions for hybrid screen calculations for optics simulations developed in LNLS, CNPEM, based on OASYS1 (https://github.com/oasys-kit/OASYS1) and ShadowOui (https://github.com/oasys-kit/ShadowOui) and licensed under [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The original HYBRID code works inside OASYS environment, therefore the modifications made were purely to automatize the functions for use in python scripts, removing widget classes dependences. Dates for each adaptation can be found within the code (preamble).
