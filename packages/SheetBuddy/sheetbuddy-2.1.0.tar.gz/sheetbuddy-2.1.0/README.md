sb.generate_eda_report(output_file_name)
```



Example 2: Generating an Datasummary & EDA Report from a Local JSON File.

```python

from sheetbuddy import SheetBuddy

file_path = 'path/to/your/data.json'
output_file_name = 'enter_your_desired_name.xlsx'

sb = SheetBuddy(file_path)
sb.generate_eda_report(output_file_name)

```
Example 3: Generating an Datasummary & EDA Report from a Local CSV File.
