Backend
=========

Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Backend <https://github.com/MbodiAI/mbodied-agents/blob/main/mbodied/base/backend.py>`_ class is an abstract base class for Backend implementations. It provides the basic structure and methods required for interacting with different backend services, such as API calls for generating completions based on given messages. See `backend directory <https://github.com/MbodiAI/mbodied-agents/blob/main/mbodied/agents/backends>`_ on how various backends are implemented.
