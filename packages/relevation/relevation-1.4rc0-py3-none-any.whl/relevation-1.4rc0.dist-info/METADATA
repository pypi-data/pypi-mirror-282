A command-line searcher for [Revelation Password Manager (archived)][revelation-wayback].

Relevation is a tool to retrieve passwords stored in a password file in the format used by Revelation, from the command-line instead of through a GUI.

Only retrieval is implemented, Revelation must be used to actually edit the file.

## Installation

    $ python3 -m pip install relevation

<del>DEB and RPM packages are [available][homepage] for the appropriate Linux distributions.</del>

**Note**: (As of March 2024) I can't provide DEB nor RPM packages for now.

## Usage

Print all passwords from `file`, ask for a password:

    $ relevation -f file -a

Print passwords for entries matching `needle` from `file` using `1234` as password:

    $ relevation -f file -p 1234 needle

Print passwords for entries matching `needle`, using the file and password stored in the configuration file:

    $ relevation needle

**Note**: Replace `relevation` with `python3 -m relevation` if it the script is not available in the path.

See the [homepage] for more information on usage.

## Manual

The `docs/` directory contains the manual in _man_, PDF and HTML formats.
