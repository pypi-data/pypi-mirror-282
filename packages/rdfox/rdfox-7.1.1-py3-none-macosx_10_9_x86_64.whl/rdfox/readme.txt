The distribution of RDFox consists of the following files and directories:

- 'RDFox' (macOS/Linux) or 'RDFox.exe' (Windows): a stand-alone executable that
  can be used to run RDFox on the command line.

- 'lib': a directory containing the following libraries:

  * 'JRDFox.jar': the Java API to the native RDFox engine.

  * 'libRDFox.dylib' (macOS), 'libRDFox.so' (Linux), or 'libRDFox.dll'
    (Windows): a dynamic/shared library that implements the C and the Java
    Native APIs of RDFox.

  * 'libRDFox.lib' (Windows only): the import library needed for linking
    'libRDFox.dll' on Windows.

  * 'libRDFox-static.a' (macOS and Linux) or 'libRDFox-static.lib'
    (Windows): a static library that implements the C API of RDFox.

- 'include': a directory containing definitions for an EXPERIMENTAL C API. The
  definitions include C++ classes that can be used to make it easier to
  correctly manage the resources exposed by the C API within C++ applications.

- 'examples': a directory containing demonstration programs that show how to
  call RDFox as a library.

  * 'C': a directory containing a C source file demonstrating how to call RDFox
    via the experimental C API. The directory also contains scripts
    'compile-shared-and-run.sh' and 'compile-static-and-run.sh' on macOS and
    Linux, and scripts 'compile-shared-and-run.bat' and 'compile-static-and-run.bat'
    on Windows, which can be used to build and run the demo. On macOS and Linux, the
    scripts assumes a C-99 compliant version of gcc is available on the path. On
    Windows, the scripts assume that 'vcvars64.bat' has been executed in the shell
    prior to execution.

  * 'C++': a directory containing a C++ source file demonstrating how to call
    RDFox via the C++ wrapper for the experimental C API. The directory also
    contains scripts 'compile-shared-and-run.sh' and
    'compile-static-and-run.sh' on macOS and Linux, and scripts
    'compile-shared-and-run.bat' and 'compile-static-and-run.bat' on Windows, which
    can be used to build and run the demo. On macOS and Linux, the script assumes a
    version of g++ supporting C++11 is available on the path. On Windows, the script
    assumes that 'vcvars64.bat' has been executed in the shell prior to execution.

  * 'Java': a directory containing source code for a program demonstrating how
    to call RDFox via the JRDFox API. The 'examples/Java/build.xml' Apache Ant
    script can be used to compile and run the program.

To use JRDFox in your project, simply add JRDFox.jar to your classpath, and
make sure that the path to the dynamic library is correctly specified  when
starting your program using the following JVM option:

    -Djava.library.path=<path>
