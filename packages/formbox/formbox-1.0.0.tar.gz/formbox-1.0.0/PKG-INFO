# formbox

This tiny script formats an [mbox] file or a [maildir] as HTML or XML.
It is intended for rendering email replies on web sites and their [RSS] feed.

## Prerequisites

This Python package depends on [nh3] for HTML sanitization
and [mistune] for rendering Markdown to HTML.  It is, however,
not designed to work with HTML emails with all those CSS and Java scripts.

## Installation

It is recommended to install this package from a downstream repository,
such as [nixpkgs].

## Usage

```console
$ formbox --help
usage: formbox [-h] mailbox id template

format mailbox as HTML/XML

positional arguments:
  mailbox     path to mbox file of maildir
  id          root message ID
  template    path to template

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```
