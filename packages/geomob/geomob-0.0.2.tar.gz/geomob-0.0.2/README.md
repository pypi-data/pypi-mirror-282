# GEOMOB

Welcome to **GEOMOB**, a lightweight library designed to facilitate working with geospatial data. At the moment this library provides essential tools for preprocessing and tessellating geospatial mobility data, making it an excellent choice for developers and researchers in the field of geographic information systems (GIS). I am planning to add many more features. Stay tuned!

## Features

### Current functionalities

1. **Preprocess Module**
   - Convert input GeoJSON formats into Shapely Geometries.
   - A lightweight improved version of a stop detection algorithm (2004, Ramaswamy, H., Toyama, K.).
   - A location function to rank users locations during a time window based on different criterions.

2. **Tessellation Module**
   - Module to discretize the space of a shape.
   - Support for multiple tessellation techniques (e.g., Squared, H3, Voronoi, etc.)
   - Function to simplify complex polygons into a complex of triangles
   - Efficient function to compute a random set of points in a polygon (useful for synthetic data generation, to randomized Voronoi tessellation etc.)

## Installation
