## License for sDNAUISpec.py

This file is released under the MIT license to ease any licensing issues that may arise if incorporating in plugins to proprietary software. See sDNA.pyt or the sDNA QGIS plugin for examples of its use.
sDNAUISpec specifies a user interface and the means to produce calls to the sDNA command line tools from user input. The command line tools use standard data formats (shapefile or gdb) for interchange and can be used independently of sDNAUISpec, we consider this weak linkage to be permissible under GPL principles (otherwise it would not be possible to run open source tools on a proprietary operating system, or vice versa).
