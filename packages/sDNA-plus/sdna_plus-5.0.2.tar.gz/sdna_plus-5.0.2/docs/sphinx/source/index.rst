The principal investigator was Alain Chiaradia and the co-investigator Crispin Cooper, based at Cardiff University department of Geography and Planning and the Sustainable Places Research Institute.

As of 2024, the previously proprietary sDNA+ software has been merged with the open source sDNA Open. All features are now open source - enjoy! While this manual uses *sDNA* to refer to the software, *sDNA+* can now be used interchangeably.
