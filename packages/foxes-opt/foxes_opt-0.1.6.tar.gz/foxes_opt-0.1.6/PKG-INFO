# foxes-opt

## _under construction, not yet ready to use. Please stay tuned..._

The package *foxes-opt* provides optimization functionality for the
*Farm Optimization and eXtended yield Evaluation Software* [foxes](https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes)
and is based on the optimization interface [iwopy](https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/iwopy).

All three open-source Python packages *foxes*, *foxes-opt* and *iwopy* are provided and maintained by Fraunhofer IWES.

The calculation is fully vectorized and its fast performance is owed to [dask](https://www.dask.org/). Also the parallelization on local or remote clusters is enabled via `dask`. The wind farm
optimization capabilities invoke the [iwopy](https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/iwopy) package which
as well supports vectorization.

`foxes` is build upon many years of experience with wake model code development at IWES, starting with the C++ based in-house code _flapFOAM_ (2011-2019) and the Python based direct predecessor _flappy_ (2019-2022).
