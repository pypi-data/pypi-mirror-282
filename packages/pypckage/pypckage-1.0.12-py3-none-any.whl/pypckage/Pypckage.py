"""
Pypckage is a tool that facilitates the configuration of a python package. 
You just need to run a command in the terminal and enter some information and Pypckage takes care of everything. 
It creates the "setup.py, LICENSE, README.md, etc", all preconfigured. All you have to do is to customize the created files.
