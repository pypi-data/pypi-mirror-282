# vipassana-timer
Meditation timer for vipassana (insight meditation) with different postures.

For context - this package was originally created to work with Yuttadhammo Bhikkhu's online meditation style, which includes (optional) prostration at the beginning of the meditation, then walking meditation and then sitting. If you just want to do 'normal' sitting practice, you can still use this package, just type 's' followed by the minutes you want to do. Also, you can add your own 'postures' if you want multiple bells in the sitting session - see below.

## Requirements
 - playsound

## Installation
```sh
pip install vipassana-timer
```

or

```sh
git clone https://github.com/toxicologist/vipassana-timer
cd vipassana-timer
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
```
>meditate -h
usage: meditate [-h] [times]

Simple vipassana meditation timer

positional arguments:
  times                 Times for each meditation posture (format: 'p5w30s30')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

```

The script takes inputs for the three postures: prostration, walking, and sitting -
represented by the letters 'p', 'w', 's', each followed by the desired time, in minutes.

For example, if one wanted to do 10 minutes walking and 10 sitting:
```sh
# example usage
>meditate w10s10

#or
>meditate
Enter times (format: 'p5w30s30'): w10s10

#result

Times:
Walking: 10
Sitting: 10

Walking: 10:00 remaining
```

Or, to do 35 minutes of sitting:
```sh
>meditate s35

Times:
Sitting: 35

Sitting: 35:00 remaining
```


If you want to add your own posture, just edit the `POSTURES` variable in `__init__.py`.

## Good luck meditating! :)
