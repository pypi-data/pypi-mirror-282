A set of utilities built on top of Google Earth Engine (migrated from JavaScript)

This repository is basically a Python version of a set of utilities developed by me (@gena) while working with Google Earth Engine and migrated from JavaScript repository: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/gena/packages

For a GitHub clone of this package see: https://github.com/gee-community/ee-packages-js

There are not docs (yet), some of the utilities are demonstrated in the following presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/103gfl3gS8rokkrcMJV9qMBnkV7oLLbDf8ygDu6QaIZQ/edit?usp=sharing
