    Enhanced regex pattern to split a given text into sentences more accurately.

    - Direct speech and quotations.
    - Abbreviations, initials, and acronyms.
    - Decimal numbers and dates.
    - Ellipses and other punctuation marks used in informal text.
    - Removing control characters and format characters.
