**TL;DR:**
-  ***typed***: the `Stream[T]` class extends `Iterable[T]`
-  ***light***: `pip install streamable` with no dependency
-  ***robust***: extensively unittested with 100% coverage
- ***lazy***: evaluation at iteration and single scan of the source.
- ***concurrent***: threads-based or `asyncio`-based
- ***versatile***: includes grouping by key/period/size, exceptions catching, iteration rate limiting and progress logging, ...

---


## 1. install

```bash
pip install streamable
```

## 2. import
```python
from streamable import Stream
```

## 3. init

```python
integers: Stream[int] = Stream(range(10))
```

Instantiate a `Stream[T]` from an `Iterable[T]`.

## 4. operate

```python
odd_integer_strings: Stream[str] = (
    integers
    .filter(lambda n: n % 2)
    .map(str)
)
```

- `Stream` instances are ***immutable***: calling an operation returns a new stream.

- Operations are ***lazy***: they are only evaluated at iteration time.

- During the iteration each source element is pulled only once and then forgotten after being processed.

## 5. iterate
`Stream[T]` extends `Iterable[T]`:
```python
>>> list(odd_integer_strings)
['1', '3', '5', '7', '9']
>>> set(odd_integer_strings)
{'9', '1', '5', '3', '7'}
>>> from functools import reduce
>>> from operator import mul
>>> reduce(mul, integers)
945
>>> for odd_integer_string in odd_integer_strings: ...
```

# ðŸ“’ ***Operations***

## `.map`
Applies a function on elements.
```python
integer_strings: Stream[str] = integers.map(str)
```

It has an optional `concurrency: int` parameter to execute the function concurrently (threads-based) while preserving the order.

It has a sibling operation called `.amap` to apply an async function concurrently (see section ***`asyncio` support***).

## `.foreach`
Applies a function on elements like `.map` but yields the elements instead of the results.

```python
printed_integers: Stream[int] = integers.foreach(print)
```
It has an optional `concurrency: int` parameter to execute the function concurrently (threads-based) while preserving the order.

It has a sibling operation called `.aforeach` to apply an async function concurrently (see section ***`asyncio` support***).

## `.filter`
Keeps only elements satisfying a predicate function.

```python
pair_integers: Stream[int] = integers.filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 0)
```

## `.group`

Groups elements.

```python
parity_groups: Stream[List[int]] = integers.group(size=100, seconds=4, by=lambda i: i % 2)
```

A group is a list of `size` elements for which `by` returns the same value, but it may contain fewer elements in these cases:
- `seconds` have elapsed since the last yield of a group
- upstream is exhausted
- upstream raises an exception

All the parameters are optional.

## `.flatten`

Ungroups elements assuming that they are `Iterable`s.

```python
integers: Stream[int] = parity_groups.flatten()
```

It has an optional `concurrency` parameter to flatten several iterables concurrently (threads).

## `.slow`

Limits the rate at which elements are yielded up to a maximum `frequency` (elements per second).

```python
slow_integers: Stream[int] = integers.slow(frequency=2)
```

## `.catch`

Catches exceptions that satisfy a predicate function.

```python
safe_inverse_floats: Stream[float] = (
    integers
    .map(lambda n: 1 / n)
    .catch(lambda ex: isinstance(ex, ZeroDivisionError))
)
```

It has an optional `raise_at_exhaustion` parameter to raise the first catched exception when iteration ends.

## `.observe`

Logs the progress of iterations over this stream.

With
```python
observed_slow_integers: Stream[int] = slow_integers.observe(what="integers")
```

you should get:

```
INFO: iteration over 'integers' will be observed.
INFO: after 0:00:00.000283, 0 error and 1 `integers` yielded.
INFO: after 0:00:00.501373, 0 error and 2 `integers` yielded.
INFO: after 0:00:01.501346, 0 error and 4 `integers` yielded.
INFO: after 0:00:03.500864, 0 error and 8 `integers` yielded.
INFO: after 0:00:04.500547, 0 error and 10 `integers` yielded.
```

The amount of logs will never be overwhelming because they are produced logarithmically e.g. the 11th log will be produced when the iteration reaches the 1024th element.

## `.truncate`
Stops iteration as soon as the `when` predicate is satisfied or `count` elements have been yielded.

```python
five_first_integers: Stream[int] = integers.truncate(5)
```
is equivalent to:
```python
five_first_integers: Stream[int] = integers.truncate(when=lambda n: n == 5)
```

# ðŸ“¦ ***Notes Box***

## typing
This is a **fully typed library** (you can [`mypy`](https://github.com/python/mypy) it).

## supported Python versions
Compatible with **Python `3.7+`** (unittested for: `3.7.17`, `3.8.18`, `3.9.18`, `3.10.13`, `3.11.7`, `3.12.1`).

## support for `asyncio`
As an alternative to the threads-based concurrency available for `.map` and `.foreach` operations (via the `concurrency` parameter), one can use `.amap` and `.aforeach` operations to **apply `async` functions** concurrently on a stream:

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def slow_async_square(n: int) -> int:
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    return n ** 2

def slow_str(n: int) -> str:
    time.sleep(3)
    return str(n)

print(
    ", ".join(
        integers
        # coroutines-based concurrency
        .amap(slow_async_square, concurrency=8)
        # threads-based concurrency
        .map(slow_str, concurrency=8)
        .truncate(5)
    )
)
```
this prints (in 6s):
```bash
0, 1, 4, 9, 16
```

## CPU-bound tasks
For CPU-bound tasks, consider using the [`PyPy`](https://github.com/pypy/pypy) interpreter whose *Just In Time* (JIT) compilation should drastically improve performances, e.g. this snippet is run **50 times faster** by [`PyPy`](https://github.com/pypy/pypy) compared to standard *CPython* interpreter:
```python
# cpu_bound_script.py
from streamable import Stream
print(
    sum(
        Stream(range(1, 1_000_000_000))
        .map(lambda n: 1/n)
    )
)
```

[Few rough runtime orders of magnitude: CPython vs PyPy vs Java vs C vs Rust.](https://github.com/ebonnal/streamable/issues/10)

## Extract-Transform-Load tasks

One can leverage this library to write elegant ETL scripts, check the [**README dedicated to ETL**](README_ETL.md).

## streamable's functions
The `Stream`'s methods are also exposed as functions:
```python
from streamable.functions import slow

iterator: Iterator[int] = ...
slow_iterator: Iterator[int] = slow(iterator)
```

## change logging level
```python
import logging

logging.getLogger("streamable").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```

## visitor pattern
The `Stream` class exposes an `.accept` method and you can implement a [***visitor***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) by extending the `streamable.visitor.Visitor` class:

```python
from streamable.visitor import Visitor

class DepthVisitor(Visitor[int]):
    def visit_stream(self, stream: Stream) -> int:
        if not stream.upstream:
            return 1
        return 1 + stream.upstream.accept(self)

def stream_depth(stream: Stream) -> int:
    return stream.accept(DepthVisitor())
```
```python
>>> stream_depth(odd_integer_strings)
3
```

## go to line
Style tip: Enclose operations in parentheses to keep lines short without needing trailing backslashes `\`.

```python
stream: Stream[str] = (
    Stream(range(10))
    .map(str)
    .group(2)
    .foreach(print)
    .flatten()
    .filter()
    .catch()
)
```
