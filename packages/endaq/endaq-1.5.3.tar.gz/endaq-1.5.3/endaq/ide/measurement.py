"""
The module :py:mod:`endaq.ide.measurement` provides an abstract representation of measurement types for
easily retrieving specific data from ``.ide`` files. Several functions in :py:mod:`endaq.ide` accept
combinations of :py:class:`MeasurementType` constants for filtering datasets by sensor type.

Measurement types are represented by a set of singleton instances of :py:class:`MeasurementType`.

.. code:: python3

    import endaq.ide
    from endaq.ide.measurement import *

    doc = endaq.ide.get_doc("https://info.endaq.com/hubfs/data/surgical-instrument.ide")
    endaq.ide.get_channels(doc, ACCELERATION)
    endaq.ide.get_channels(doc, TEMPERATURE+PRESSURE)

Strings may also be used, either in combination with or instead of, the :py:class:`MeasurementType` instances.
The strings can be abbreviated, but no shorter than three characters.
