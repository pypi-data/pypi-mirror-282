Lunarcord
---------

A swift, fast, and beginner-friendly library for easily writing multi-purpose discord bots.

Inspired by discord, pycord, nextcord, and other discord forks.
This package is NOT a discord fork!

Features
--------

- Makes use of **async-await** technologies
- Speedy and **easy-to-use**
- Includes **most** features implemented by other packages

Missing
-------

Lunarcord misses some unimplemented functionalities, which are to be added in the future, such as:

- Customizable bot intents
- Sharding and auto-sharding
- Voice gateway - connecting to voice call
- Slash command auto-complete
- And sadly more, please message me on discord @revolno to inform me.

Installation
------------

Lunarcord requires **Python 3** or higher.
You can install **Lunarcord** from your terminal:

.. code:: sh

    # Linux / MacOS
    python3 -m pip install -U lunarcord

    # Windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U lunarcord

Example
-------

.. code:: py

    import lunarcord


    bot = lunarcord.Bot()

    @bot.slashCommand()
    async def ping(interaction: lunarcord.Interaction):
        """A test ping-pong slash command!"""
        await interaction.send("Pong!")

    bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
