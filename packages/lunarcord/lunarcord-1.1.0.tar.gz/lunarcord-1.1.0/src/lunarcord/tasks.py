'''
A lunarcord extension for scheduling time-consuming tasks to be ran in a separate `Thread` without blocking your code or your bot.
Below is an example implementation showing what can be done with this extension:

```
from lunarcord import tasks, Bot
import asyncio

bot = Bot()

@tasks.task()
async def myTask():

    print("Before sleep")
    await asyncio.sleep(100) # Sleeps for 100 seconds.
    print("After sleep")
    
@tasks.loop(every=10)
async def myLoop(iteration: int):

    myChannel = await bot.fetchChannel(12345678)
    await myChannel.send(f"Iteration number **{iteration}**.")
    
bot.run("TOKEN")
```

The task ("myTask") created above prints something, waits for 100 seconds, then prints another message. If a `Task` was not used for this, your bot would run AFTER the waiting had finished. From the other hand, those two tasks (waiting and starting the bot) are done in parallel thanks to the usage of a lunarcord task.
Another reason you may want to make use of a `Task` is because you want to run an `async def` function (with `await`), which is not possible in non-async context.

The "myLoop" loop created in the example is a lunarcord `Loop`. This is a subclass of lunarcord's `Task` class that allows you to schedule a task to be ran not once, not twice, but forever until it has been stopped, every `every` (look at the decorator's `every=100` argument) seconds.
This is like using a `while True` loop, with the difference, again, that this does not block the rest of your code.
For more examples, read more about `Tasks` in lunarcord's official docs (`SOON`).
