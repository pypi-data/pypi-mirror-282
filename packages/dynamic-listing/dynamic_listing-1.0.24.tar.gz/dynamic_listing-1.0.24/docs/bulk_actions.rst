Bulk Actions with Confirmation Messages User Manual
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Welcome to the User Manual for the Bulk Actions with Confirmation Messages feature. This feature empowers your web application with the ability to perform bulk actions, such as deleting multiple items, with built-in confirmation messages and customizable options. This manual will guide you through the integration and usage of this feature, ensuring enhanced user experience and security in your web application.


Using the Bulk Actions Feature
-------------------------------

To utilize the Bulk Actions feature effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Include Libraries:**

Ensure that your web application includes the required libraries:

- **SweetAlert Library:** This feature uses the SweetAlert library to display confirmation modals with custom messages and buttons.
- **Toastr Library:** Toastr is used for displaying notifications after successful actions or errors.


2. **Add Bulk Action Anchor Tags:**

To use the Bulk Actions feature, add an anchor tag with the `data-toggle="bulk-action"` attribute to your HTML. Customize the attributes for your specific use case. For instance, here's an example of a "Delete Selected" button:

.. code-block:: html

   <a href="/delete-articles/"
      data-request-method="POST"
      data-toggle="bulk-action"
      data-confirm-message="Are you sure you want to delete the selected articles?"
      data-input-type="selected">Delete Selected</a>

HTML Attributes Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's a summary of the HTML attributes used in the example:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Is required
     - Options
     - Description
   * - data-toggle="bulk-action"

     - URL for the action.
   * - data-request-method
     - optional
     - selected, queryset, none (default: "selected").
     - Determines the action target items:
       - **selected**: uses selected listing items ids as value

   * - data-force-reload
     - optional
     - default: "true"
     - Reloads the page after action confirmed. When set to "false," it doesn't reload the page and uses the provided "data-callback" to handle the response.
   * - data-callback
     - required with `data-force-reload="false"`
     - default: ''
     - Executes the provided function in its value.

     - Choose an icon for the cancellation notification.
   * - data-cancel-action
     - optional
     - default: "Ok, got it!"
     - Sets the cancel notification button text.

**Define Callback Function**
Define the callback function, such as `handleDeletionCallback`, which will be called after the action is completed. If `data-force-reload` is set to `false`, the response data is accessible via the `this` keyword:

.. code-block:: html

       <a href="/delete-articles/"
          data-request-method="POST"
          data-toggle="bulk-action"
          data-confirm-message="Are you sure you want to delete the selected articles?"
          data-force-reload="false"
          data-callback="handleDeletionCallback"
          data-input-type="selected">Delete Selected</a>

       <script>
           function handleDeletionCallback() {
           console.log("Bulk deletion completed:", this);
           // Additional handling or notifications can be added here
           }
       </script>


Usage with Custom Forms
-----------------------

Sometimes you may want to build a bulk action with actual forms while still leveraging the functionality provided by the package. To achieve this, the package provides two functions for you:

1. `addBulkActionsInputsToForm` Function

   This function updates the form with the input `type` and `value` that you use in the request. Here's how to use it:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var form = document.getElementById('delete-form');
      BulkActions.addBulkActionsInputsToForm(form, "selected");

   In this example, `addBulkActionsInputsToForm` is used to update the `delete-form` with the selected items' IDs as input values.

2. `resetBulkActionsInputs` Function

   This function resets the inputs in case of canceling an action. Here's how to use it:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var form = document.getElementById('delete-form');
      BulkActions.resetBulkActionsInputs(form);

   In this example, `resetBulkActionsInputs` is used to reset the inputs in the `delete-form` after canceling an action.

These functions allow you to seamlessly integrate bulk actions with your custom forms, enhancing the usability and flexibility of the package.

.. note::
    before you use this section you might need to make sure the BulkActions method is initialized so you can use this function
    
    .. code-block:: javascript

        document.addEventListener('BulkActionsInitialized', function() {
      
          // your code here
        
        })
        


Handling Backend Views
----------------------

In your Django views, you can easily handle incoming data from HTTP requests, which may come in different formats. This section explains how to handle incoming data using the provided `BulkActionMixin` and a sample view.

Assuming you have a view, such as `BlogDeleteView`, that needs to handle bulk actions, you can use the `BulkActionMixin` to simplify the process. The mixin provides the `get_actions_type_and_value` method to parse the incoming data.

Let's see how to integrate the `BulkActionMixin` into your view:

.. code-block:: python

    from dynamic_listing.views import BulkActionMixin
    from django.views import View

    class BlogDeleteView(BulkActionMixin, View):
        def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
           # Use the BulkActionMixin to get the action type and value
           input_type, value = self.get_actions_type_and_value(request.POST)

           # Now, you can use 'input_type' and 'value' as needed in your view logic

           # Example usage:
           if input_type == 'selected':
               # Handle selected items based on 'value'
               pass
           elif input_type == 'queryset':
               # Handle queryset items based on 'value'
               pass
           else:
               # Handle other cases where 'value' is None
               pass

           # Continue with your view logic based on the parsed data

In this example, the `BlogDeleteView` class uses the `BulkActionMixin` to easily retrieve the action type and value from the incoming POST data. This simplifies the process of handling different types of bulk actions.

You can then use `input_type` and `value` as needed in your view logic. For instance, you can handle selected items, queryset items, or other scenarios based on the parsed data.

By using the `BulkActionMixin`, you can streamline the handling of bulk actions in your Django views, making your code more organized and maintainable.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter issues or unexpected behavior while using the Bulk Actions with Confirmation Messages feature, consider the following troubleshooting tips:

1. **Check Button Attributes:**

   Double-check that you've correctly added the required attributes to your action buttons. Ensure that the `data-toggle` attribute is set to "bulk-action" for bulk actions to function properly.

2. **Library Dependencies:**

   Ensure you've included the SweetAlert and Toastr libraries in your project. Without these libraries, the confirmation modals and notifications won't work as intended.

3. **`csrfToken` Variable:**

   Remember to set the `csrfToken` variable before using the feature for authentication. This variable is crucial for CSRF protection when performing actions that modify data on the server.

4. **Error Handling:**

   If you encounter errors during bulk actions or confirmations, check your browser's console for detailed error messages. JavaScript errors or issues with library dependencies may be logged there.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you can identify and resolve common issues that may arise while using the Bulk Actions feature. If you continue to experience problems, consider reaching out to our support team for further assistance.
