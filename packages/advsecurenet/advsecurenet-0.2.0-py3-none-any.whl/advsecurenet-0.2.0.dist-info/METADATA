AdvSecureNet is a Python library for Machine Learning Security, developed by [Melih Catal](https://github.com/melihcatal) at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) as part of his Master's Thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Manuel GÃ¼nther](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/aiml/people/guenther.html). The main focus of the library is on adversarial attacks and defenses for vision tasks, with plans to extend support to other tasks such as natural language processing.

The library provides tools to generate adversarial examples, evaluate the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks, and train robust machine learning models. Built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), it is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to run experiments with different configurations.

## Features

**Adversarial Attacks:** AdvSecureNet supports a diverse range of evasion attacks on computer vision tasks, including gradient-based, decision-based, single-step, iterative, white-box, black-box, targeted, and untargeted attacks, enabling comprehensive testing and evaluation of neural network robustness against various types of adversarial examples.

**Adversarial Defenses:** The toolkit includes adversarial training and ensemble adversarial training. Adversarial training incorporates adversarial examples into the training process to improve model robustness, while ensemble adversarial training uses multiple models or attacks for a more resilient defense strategy.

**Evaluation Metrics:** AdvSecureNet supports metrics like accuracy, robustness, transferability, and similarity. Accuracy measures performance on clean data, robustness assesses resistance to attacks, transferability evaluates how well adversarial examples deceive different models, and similarity quantifies perceptual differences using PSNR and SSIM.

**Multi-GPU Support:** AdvSecureNet is optimized for multi-GPU setups, enhancing the efficiency of training, evaluation, and adversarial attack generation, especially for large models and datasets or complex methods. By utilizing multiple GPUs in parallel, AdvSecureNet aims to reduce computational time, making it ideal for large-scale experiments and deep learning models.

**CLI and API Interfaces:** AdvSecureNet offers both CLI and API interfaces. The CLI allows for quick execution of attacks, defenses, and evaluations, while the API provides advanced integration and extension within user applications.

**External Configuration Files:** The toolkit supports YAML configuration files for easy parameter tuning and experimentation. This feature enables users to share experiments, reproduce results, and manage setups effectively, facilitating collaboration and comparison.

**Built-in Models and Datasets Support:** AdvSecureNet supports all PyTorch vision library models and well-known datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, FashionMNIST, and SVHN. Users can start without additional setup, but the toolkit also allows for custom datasets and models, offering flexibility for various research and applications.

**Automated Adversarial Target Generation:** AdvSecureNet can automatically generate adversarial targets for targeted attacks, simplifying the process and ensuring consistent and reliable results. As a user, you don't need to manually specify targets. This feature is especially useful for targeted attacks on large datasets. You can also provide custom targets if you prefer.

## Usage

The library can be used as a command line tool or as an importable Python package.

### Command Line Tool

Use the `advsecurenet` command to interact with the library. Use `advsecurenet --help` to see available commands and options. It is recommended to use YAML configuration files to run experiments. You can list the available configuration options using `advsecurenet utils configs list` and generate a template configuration file using `advsecurenet utils configs get -c <config_name> -o <output_file>`.

Running an adversarial attack:

```bash
advsecurenet attack -c ./fgsm.yml
```

Running an adversarial defense:

```bash
advsecurenet defense adversarial-training -c ./adv_training.yml
```

Running an evaluation:

```bash
advsecurenet evaluate benign -c ./evaluate_benign.yml

or

advsecurenet evaluate adversarial -c ./evaluate_adversarial.yml
```

### Python Package

You can import the library as a Python package. You can use the `advsecurenet` module to access the library. You can find the available modules and classes in the [documentation](http://melihcatal.github.io/advsecurenet/).

## Examples

Examples of different use cases can be found in the [examples](./examples/) directory.

## Architecture

The high-level architecture of the toolkit is shown in the figure below.

![advsecurenet_arch](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/SdKAyOZs1d9bcin/download)

![cli-arch](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/ZbjIHBHql0dV6n0/download)

The toolkit is designed to be modular and extensible. CLI and Python API are implemented separately, however, they share the same core components and they have the same package structure for the sake of consistency. Tests are implemented for both CLI and Python API to ensure the correctness of the implementation and again they follow the same structure. The toolkit is designed to be easily extensible, new attacks, defenses, and evaluation metrics can be added by implementing the corresponding classes and registering them in the corresponding registries.

## Comparison with Other Libraries

AdvSecureNet stands out among adversarial machine learning toolkits like IBM ART, AdverTorch, SecML, FoolBox, ARES, and CleverHans. Key advantages include:

â¢ **Active Maintenance:** Ensures ongoing support and updates.
â¢ **Comprehensive Training Support:** One of the few toolkits supporting both adversarial and ensemble adversarial training.
â¢ **Multi-GPU Support:** The first toolkit with native multi-GPU support for attacks, defenses, and evaluations, ideal for large-scale experiments.
â¢ **Flexible Interfaces:** The first toolkit that fully supports CLI, API usage, and external YAML configuration files for reproducibility for all features.
â¢ **Performance:** AdvSecureNet excels in performance, significantly reducing execution times on multi-GPU setups. For example, the multi-GPU PGD attack time (107 seconds) is faster than ARESâs best single GPU time (183 seconds). Adversarial training time is reduced from 304 seconds on a single GPU to 166 seconds with 7 GPUs, a speedup of 1.83x.
