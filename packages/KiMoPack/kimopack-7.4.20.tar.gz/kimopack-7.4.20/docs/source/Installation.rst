The basis of the program is a module called "plot_func.py" that contains all the necessary functions and classes. 
We recommend to use a package manager to install the program.  

Install using "pip":

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install KiMoPack 

Upgrade if already installed:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install KiMoPack -U

Install and update using "conda" from the channel erdzeichen:

.. code-block:: text

    $ conda install -c erdzeichen kimopack

Hint: the pip version is usually more recent than the conda version
The files can also be downloaded from the github directory https://github.com/erdzeichen/KiMoPack or zenodo (see below)

In general it is a good idea to create a local environment to install files in python if you are using python for many tasks. 
In a local environment only the packages that are needed are installed, which usually avoids that conflicts can appear. 
It is very easy to do that. 

Under Windows: open the anaconda command prompt or power shell (type anaconda in the windows startmenu) 
Under Linuxs: open a console

.. code-block:: text

	$ conda create --name KiMoPack
	$ conda activate KiMoPack
	$ conda install pytables
	
If you are working with a very old installation it is usually a good idea to also install an updated python 

.. code-block:: text

	$ conda create --name KiMoPack python=3.10 ipython jupyterlab jupyter
	$ conda activate KiMoPack
	$ conda install pytables

into this environment KiMoPack can then be installed. We also recommend (optional) to install 
python-pptx to create power point slides and nbopen (which allows to automatically open a local server) 
into the environments. If one of the installs complains (error) that the user does not has sufficient rights, 
this installation can be done attaching "--user" to the following commands

.. code-block:: text

	pip install kimopack

	pip install python-pptx
	pip install nbopen

	
Finally, while still in the environement, activate nbopen. There are different commands for Windows/Linux/Mac.
By doing that in the local environment will open and activate the environment. If you left the environement 
already you can always go back with "conda activate KiMoPack".

.. code-block:: text

	python -m nbopen.install_win
	python3 -m nbopen.install_xdg
	Clone the repository and run ./osx-install.sh


Best usage
-----------
While KiMoPack is a python library, we facilitate its use with Jupyter notebooks. For the typical analysis tasks we have developed a series of Notebooks that guide through the tasks.\n 
These notebooks can be downloaded from https://github.com/erdzeichen/KiMoPack/tree/main/Workflow_tools or by command line. 

To do that start any console (under windows e.g. type "cmd" and hit enter). In the console you then start python by typing "python" and hit enter, lastly you import Kimopack and run a function that downloads the files for you by typing "import KiMoPack; KiMoPack.download_all()" This downloads the notebooks and tutorials from github for you. If you instead use "import KiMoPack; KiMoPack.download_notebooks()" then only the workflow tools are downloaded.
Please copy one of these notebooks into your data analysis folder and rename them to create a analysis log of your session. For more information please see the publication https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.2c00907, the tutorial videos, or the tutorial notebooks under https://github.com/erdzeichen/KiMoPack/tree/main/Tutorial_Notebooks_for_local_use.

Under windows this would be:

.. code-block:: text

    $ pip install nbopen
$ python -m nbopen.install_win
