This extension is available on PyPI. We are actively developing
this extension and until a stable release (`1.0.0`) is made it
is possible that breaking changes will be introduced. If you
are using this extension please let us know so we can look into
adding your project to downstream testing in our CI.

Alternatively this extension can be installed by cloning
and installing the git repository.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf-zarr
