Question: What is the surface area and bandgap of ACOGEF?
Thought: I need to find the surface area of ACOGEF.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name ACOGEF and provide information on its surface area"
Observation: The surface area of material "ACOGEF" is 1138.35 m^2/g. Check to see if this answer can be you final answer, and if so, you should submit your final answer.
Thought: The search_csv tool provided the surface area of ACOGEF, but not the bandgap. I need to find the bandgap.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "Search name ACOGEF and provide information on its bandgap"
Observation: The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the bandgap of ACOGEF. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
Thought: The search_csv tool provided the surface area of ACOGEF, but not the bandgap. I need to find the bandgap.
Action: predictor
Action Input: "Predict the bandgap of ACOGEF"
Observation: The bandgap of material "ACOGEF" is 3.41139 eV. Check to see if this answer can be you final answer, and if so, you should submit your final answer.
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The bandgap and surface area of ACOGEF is 3.41149 eV and 1138.35 m^2/g.

Question: What is the highest bandgap MOF?
Thought: I need to find the MOF with the highest bandgap.
Action: search_csv
Action Input: "find for MOFs with highest bandgap and provide its name and bandgap"
Observation: There are no data in database
Thought: The search_csv tool did not provide any information on the bandgaps of MOFs. I need to find another way to obtain this information.
Action: predictor
Action Input: "predict the bandgaps of MOFs and find the name of MOF with highest bandgaps"
Observation: The highest bandgap MOF is ACOGEF.
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: The highest bandgap MOF is ACOGEF.
