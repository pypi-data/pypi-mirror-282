"""
Python 2 and 3 code to generate 4 and 5 digit NACA profiles

Notes
----------
The NACA airfoils are airfoil shapes for aircraft wings developed
by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).
The shape of the NACA airfoils is described using a series of
digits following the word "NACA". The parameters in the numerical
code can be entered into equations to precisely generate the
cross-section of the airfoil and calculate its properties.
