# Waffle CLI

Waffle helps one deploy a secrure foundation for web applications and host their backend and frontend components using AWS.

A few of the core principles of Waffle:
- Help deploy projects in fast.
- Secure infrastructure that enable good practices for application security.
- SOC II audit ready.
- Open source infrastructure-as-code. (For AWS)
- No locking in. If your project's scope grows larger than what Waffle provides then you can easily add your custom components or modify Waffle's open source templates as needed.
