class MyArt(TurtleArt):
    def _draw_art(self) -> None:
        pass


# Example usage:

artwork.draw()
screen.mainloop()
```

#### Methods

### Rectangle Class

The `Rectangle` class is a subclass of `TurtleArt` that allows you to draw rectangles on the screen.

#### Usage

from turtle import Screen, Turtle
from turtle_art_manager import Rectangle

# Example usage:
screen = Screen()
pen = Turtle()
rectangle = Rectangle(screen, pen, width=150, height=80)
rectangle.draw(fill_color=True)
screen.mainloop()
```

### Circle Class

The `Circle` class is another subclass of `TurtleArt` that allows you to draw circles on the screen.

#### Usage

```python

```

#### Attributes
